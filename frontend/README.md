## 🧾 Lore Scroll

In this universe, functions are fighters. Realms are themed by syntax. The Function Fighters — GoReala™, Namina™, Anon-X™, and others — guide new coders through the terrain.

🌀 When you learn a concept, you unlock a **Scroll of Infinite Knowledge™**. These scrolls are not just information — they’re **visual metaphors with emotional memory hooks**, designed to help you remember _how_ code works, not just _what it says_.
